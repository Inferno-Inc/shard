--- 

[Shard Coin][website-url] is designed to be a secure and decentralised open source proof of stake digital currency, focusing on performance, security and fast low-cost transactions. The Shard Community Reserve assists with market liquidity and reducing volatility. With the community we are looking to revolutionise the cryptocurrency experience allowing users easy access and usability, bringing it to the mainstream for day to day life.

Shard can be used not only as a cryptocurrency, but also as a utility coin in multiple Shardax projects. Such as the Shardax Digital Asset Exchange & Staking Platform, Universal Infinity Wallet and the Quantum Project. In addition to the extra benefits when using Shard on these platforms; Shardax uses 20% of profits for liquidity, buying and burning Shard. This will decrease the existing supply, while coin holders can continuously stake without excessive inflation.

Shard development tree

Shard is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.

Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of Shard.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be
labeled 'stale'.
